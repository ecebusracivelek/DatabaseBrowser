This project develops a user friendly db browser which supports following functional requirements:
• Initial screen asking db url, username, and password and a “connect” button.
• Having successfully connected to the server the main screen is displayed. In the main
screen, the list of databases-schemas- which are stored on the server will be displayed.
• Selecting one of the databases, the list of relations will be displayed. Changing the
selected db, list of relations should be updated automatically.
• Selecting one of the relations, its data will be displayed in a table. When the selected
relation is changed, the data should be updated automatically.
• Insert, update, and delete operations into/from selected relations should also be
supported.
